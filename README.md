## Transcriptome-based subgrouping of ASD mouse models

The analysis pipeline and custom scripts used in the manuscript are listed below..

### Pipeline Stages:
1. bulk RNA-seq mapping (using Salmon)
2. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis (using DEseq2)
3. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 
4. Alternative Splicing analysis
5. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
6. Cell type deconvolution analysis

### Script Number:
Script numbers represent scripts within a pipeline step. 

For example, script #02_Differential_Gene_Expression.R contains code for Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis (using DEseq2).
